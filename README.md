# clj.jdbc

Alternative implementation of jdbc wrapper for clojure.

For this momment, the official wrapper `clojure.jdbc` has very unclear
api and it doing a lot of implicit things such as connection management.

This library intends make more simple and clear api to jdbc than the
official library.

**NOTE:** this project is not ready for use.

Why clj.jdbc does not include dsl for working with sql as clojure.java.jdbc 0.3?
================================================================================

Write programs that do one thing and do it well. clj.jdbc is a wrapper for a java jdbc, not
a wrapper and a lot of things more. Now, already exists a lot of dsl for work with sql.
clj.jdbc will not reinvent the wheel.

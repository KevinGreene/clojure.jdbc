Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to **clj.jdbc** should keep these important rules in mind.

Project Maturity
----------------

**clj.jdbc** is a young project and can have some bugs. After the beta5 api
is considered stable and there should not be any change that breaks compatibility.
